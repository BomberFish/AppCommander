# AppCommander

A swiss army knife for your iPhone apps.

Supported versions: 15.0-16.6.1, 17.0.0

## Disclaimer

This is an early preview of AppCommander v2, which has been completely rebuilt from the ground up. I am not responsible for bricked devices, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. YOU are choosing to install this untested app, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I **will** laugh at you.
